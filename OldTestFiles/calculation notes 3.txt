exponentiation.  There are an infinite number of ways to define exponentiation
that satisfy the minimum rules of a consistent algebraic system, but we would like to choose
one that "feels" like regular scalar exponentiation.  To do this, we will hold our system to
the following constraint:


1.) Magnitude of an exponentiation:
Exponentiation of a vector by another vector will amplify the magnitude of the resulting
vector equally to the exponentiation of the two magnitudes.
If W = X^V, |W| = |X| ^ |Y|

I would actually like to prove this if possible.






If A = B ^ C, then
A' = B ^ C / (B * C)
A' = (B ^ (C - I)) / C
A' / A = C

Since division of vectors results in simple subtraction of angles, we can say
θA' =  θA - θC
θA - θA' = θC



Furthermore, since A^(B+C) = A^B * A^C,
If we say X=A^B and Y=A^C
θA  = θX + θY
However, if C=n*I, θY=θA



so θA = θX
Therefore, for any vector B=n*I', and any other vector C=m*I', where n and m are real numbers,
A^(B+C) = A^B * A^Z
θA = θA^B
Therefore, for rotation, we can totally ignore the real component of the exponentiation!
in other words,
If A = B^C and C'=(0, Cy), or D = (n, Cy), where n is any real number,
A^C = A^C' = A^D
This is totally crazy!  But my test results show this to be true.

From here, we can finally fully define rotation from vector exponentiation:
A^(B) = A^(B') = A^(B+n*I) where B'=I'*By and n is any real number
(A^B)^C = A^(B*C)
θ[(A^B)^C] = θ[A^(B*C)]
if B=n*I' and C=m*I' (we can ignore the real components of these vectors)
B*C=n*m*I'*I'=-n*m*I
So if V=A^B^C:
A^B^C=A^(B*C)=A^(-n*m*I)
θV=0A
This is also crazy!  It says that whenever there is rotation from vector exponentiation, if it happens twice,
it goes back to 0.
This means...in our system, if A^B = C,  θC = θA + pi if B has an imaginary component, and θC = θA otherwise.
What a strange coincidence!  Exponentiation either rotates the vector by a half turn or not at all!
However, my test results do not like this...I'll need to think more about it.

Now, let's look at C = n * I':
θA' =  θA - θC
θA' =  θA - n * θI'
θA' =  θA - pi / 4
θA - θA' = pi / 4

Since division of vectors results in simple subtraction of angles, we can say
that if W = X ^ Y, θW is equal to θW = θX * (θY - 1) - θY

To test if this is a valid interpretation, we must prove that our implementation
meets all the algebraic requirements of an exponentiation system:
https://mathinsight.org/exponentiation_basic_rules

Our test suite does in fact prove this.

Finally, we need to implement a logarithm, which is the inverse of the
exponentiation.

If X^V = W, the logarithm is defined as follows:
logX(W) = V

We already know how to determine X^V:
W = |X| ^ |V| < θX * (θY - 1) - θY

What is a function, which given this input, will give the correct output?

Let's see what happens when one of these is the E vector:
If E ^ V = W, the natural logarithm is defined as follows:
LN(W) = V

So what is the output of E ^ V?
W = |E| ^ |V| < θE * (θV - 1) - θV

since θE = 0, this is simplified:
W = |E| ^ |V| < - θV

From here, it is obvious what the LN operator needs to be:
LN(W) = ln(|W|) < - θW

Our logarithm must meet the basic requirements for logarithms:

Our test suite proves this to be the case.
